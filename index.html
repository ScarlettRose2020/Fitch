      <h2>Hello!!!</h2>
      <p class="intro">My name is Scarlett Fitch and I am a YouTuber. I currently live in England, and I was born in 2007. I absolutely love being a YouTuber and I hope to make YouTube my career for the rest of my life. I started uploading YouTube videos in March of 2020. I want to make videos that show people my life, as well as funny moments, and also show people how to be healthy and fit.</p>

        <h3>YouTuber</h3>
<img class="skill-image2" src="" alt="">
      <p>I have two YouTube channels, one named Scarlett Rose, and the other named Fitch Fitness. which is my main channel. On that channel, I upload vlogs about myself, family, friends, and my daily life experiences throughout time. I share my makeup and fitness routines, do Q&A videos, baking videos, and much more fun and random content.  My other channel, Fitch Fitness, is where I post videos showing my fitness routines, as well as different ways for people to stay healthy, actice, and fit. I hope to influence the world and to make people laugh. My plan is to go to college after High School and major in film and editing to help me further my YouTube channel and to make better videos with greater quality and content.</p>

<h3>Fitness</h3>

<p>I am educated in fitness from watching other YouTubers and I love to keep healthy and fit. I try to stick to a daily routine and workout to keep myself healthy and fit. I love to stretch before and after I workout because it is good for your muscles and makes you feel more refreshed.</p>


<h3>Cook</h3>
<p>I love cooking for my family. I learned a lot of different recipes, and I am learning a lot more to get better at cooking and to have more knowledge about cooking. One of my favorite things to make is banana pancakes. You can see my YouTube video where I show you how I make banana pancakes. I also cook healthy food too. On my Fitch Fitness channel, I have a video where I explain how to make protein brownies. I will have more and more videos about healthy foods and drinks that you can use to make yourself strong and healthy.</p>
